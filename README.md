# DAIT-APPLICATION — DVT TREATMENT SUPPORT

## Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) Blood Clot Detection

This project aims to develop an AI system for detecting Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) using ultrasound (DICOM) imaging. We request community support by contributing medical ultrasound data to improve model accuracy.
